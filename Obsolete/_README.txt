This data synthesis was prepared by the COASTAL CARBON NETWORK (CCN) hosted at the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. These datasets were downloaded from the Coastal Carbon Atlas, a map interface which accesses the CCN's Data Library (https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCN-Data-Library).

 YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A DATA USER: The data that you have downloaded is curated and provided by the CCN but is not solely attributable to the CCN. Each data source should be credited to the original data contributor(s) and should be cited appropriately in subsequent studies (see CCN_bibliography.bib). While we provide a bibliography file, you are responsible for accurately citing any sources you use. See the CCN Data Use Policy for more information. (https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/principles-and-governance#data-use-policy). 

 USES OF THE DATA: The downloaded data is provided as-is and are meant for academic use. There is no warranty associated with this download. The CCN data library is subject to amendment, correction, and addition. Please subscribe to our dataset email list, or email CoastalCarbon@si.edu if you would like to be periodically notified of changes. 

 ACKNOWLEDGING THE CCN: The maintainers of the Coastal Carbon Library and Atlas do not require, nor expect, offers of co-authorship in exchange for serving this data, only when we make substantial new contributions to a work in line with CRediT taxonomy of roles (https://credit.niso.org/) for collaborations. If you benefit from downloading this synthesized data, please credit the CCN's Coastal Carbon Atlas (https://shiny.si.edu/coastal_carbon_atlas/) and current version of the Data Library (https://doi.org/10.25573/serc.21565671) with the date downloaded, in your papers or derivative products.

 ABOUT THE CCN: The Coastal Carbon Network (https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon) seeks to accelerate the pace of discovery in coastal wetland carbon science by providing our community with access to data, analysis tools, and synthesis opportunities. Our activities include bringing data libraries online, creating open source analysis and modeling tools, providing training and outreach opportunities, hosting data synthesis workshops targeted at strategically reducing uncertainty in coastal carbon science issues, and to create a community of practice.
